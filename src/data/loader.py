---------
Loads and prepares the NLI-RE premise-hypothesis sentence pairs for training.

In the NLI-RE framework (Section 3), each input sentence s containing two
named entity mentions n_i and n_j is treated as the premise. The corresponding
hypothesis is a verbalized candidate relation constructed from a template T_r.
This module loads the pre-built (premise, hypothesis, label) triples from
JSONL files and wraps them in a structured container for the training pipeline.

Data format (JSONL — one record per line):
    {
        "sentence_id":  "...",
        "sentence":     "raw Arabic sentence s",
        "subject":      "entity n_i",
        "object":       "entity n_j",
        "relation":     "Relation.type",
        "hypothesis":   "verbalized Arabic hypothesis h",
        "nli_sentence": "[CLS] s [SEP] h",
        "Label":        "True" | "False"
